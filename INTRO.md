A short introduction about your team:
Meet JSB Foundation!

We are an independent standards body that oversees and oversees the development of JSB FINANCE - a decentralized public blockchain. JSB Finance owns a great technology platform with the advantages of Tron's blockchain system. The core focus of the JSB Foundation is to accelerate the adoption of JSB FINANCE and to empower integration and execution, allowing for rapid track value creation for inclusive and equitable growth - for both the few and many people.

As the legal custodian of the protocol and custodian of the JSB FINANCE brand, the organization works to promote viable use cases and partnerships, growing the broader blockchain community shaping laws and commercial standards, and ensuring accountability of stakeholders. We are caregivers of the JSB FINANCE ecosystem and its community advocates.

To fulfill these critical roles to the highest standards - and to ensure we maintain decentralization, autonomy, and objectivity - we have our own Board of Directors and a diverse, global team.
Welcome aboard.
